# POS-Tagger

## Problem Set 5 of COSC 10 Dartmouth College

In this lab, I and a classmate implemented a Hidden Markov Model to develop a predictive model of parts of speech, later to be integrated with the Viterbi algorithm to process a user-inputted sentence by tagging each word in the sentence with its part of speech.

In this repo, you will find the code to the program, the test data, as well as a video demonstrating the use of the program.
